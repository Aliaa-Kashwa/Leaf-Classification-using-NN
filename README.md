# Leaf-Classification-using-NN
The objective of this playground competition is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin &amp; texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants.

In this project, we will use the Leaf Classification dataset using a neuralnetwork architecture.
